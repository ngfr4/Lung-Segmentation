# Semi-Automated Lung Segmentation and 3D Volume Reconstruction from CT Scans

## Abstract
Under the umbrella of Medical Image Processing, this project has focused to execute a series of pre-processing steps, facilitating a semi-automated segmentation and subsequent volume extraction of the lungs. An evaluation of three distinct methods was conducted to determine the most effective technique for lung segmentation and to acquire a refined volumetric representation of the pulmonary structure, thereby enabling 3D visualizations derived from CT image reconstructions. The ultimate aim was to achieve accurate lung segmentation within images characterized by noise.
